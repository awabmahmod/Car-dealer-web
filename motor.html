    <h2 class="ask"> Let me tell you why electric motorcycles beat gas motorcycles </h2>
    <p class="text">
        Look, I’ve ridden electric motorcycles and I’ve ridden gas motorcycles. I’ve owned multiple of both.
        And they’re both so much fun that I feel like I’m doing something illegal.
        But at the end of the day, I’d choose an electric motorcycle 9 times out of 10.
        They have so many advantages over gas bikes. And to save you time,
        I’ll list the five most important below.
    </p>
    <span11>Instant torque and power </span11>
    <p class="text">
        If performance is what you’re after, it’s hard to compete against electric motorcycles. And that’s not hyperbole
        either. Electric superbikes like the Lightning LS-218 have often taken the top spot on the podium against gas
        bikes, such as in the Pikes Peak hill climb race.

        While gas-powered engines take longer to spool up peak power and torque, which require the engine to be spinning
        at high RPMs, electric motors reach peak power and torque instantly from 0 RPM. They maintain more consistent
        power and torque through the entire RPM range too.

        That means you can achieve comparable performance to a gas bike with a much lighter and smaller electric
        motorcycle, or you can go with a larger electric superbike and get insane acceleration.
    </p>
    <span11>Electric motorcycles are more comfortable </span11>
    <p class="text">
        This one is obviously a matter of personal preference, but I find electric motorcycles to be more comfortable in
        a number of ways.
        You also don’t have to worry about burning yourself on a hot exhaust header. You might think those burns give
        you street cred. But trust me, your girlfriend doesn’t. And she absolutely doesn’t want any.
        Electric motorcycles are also more comfortable for riding in traffic and other urban scenarios. With no clutch
        or gears to worry about, you can enjoy the ride instead of clutching and shifting every three seconds.
        Another win for comfort and I know this one will be controversial, is the lack of exhaust noise. Electric
        motorcycles aren’t actually silent,
        If you’re an old gas-bike hold out then this is probably the point where you go all “ha, gotcha now! I love
        shifting and so I’d never get an electric bike!”

        Well I’m sorry to burst your bubble, but there are multiple electric motorcycle options that preserve the manual
        gearbox. From electric cruisers to sport bikes, there are gear shifting electric motorcycle options out there.
    </p>
    <span11> Tuning and updates</span11>
    <br>
    <img src="./css2/update.webp" height="500px" class="bla">
    <p class="text">
        Part of the fun of riding a motorcycle is modding it, customizing it, and making the performance suit your
        needs.
        With an electric motorcycle, that’s as easy as pulling out your phone and moving a few slider bars in an app.
        There are no carburetors to mess with, no engine timing to adjust, no injector profiles, no greasy hands, no
        weekends missed riding because your bike is still up on the lift. It’s just easier.
    </p>
    <span11> Electric bikes are more convenient</span11>
    <p class="text">
        ectric motorcycles are simply more convenient. There, I said it.
        Imagine if you had a gas station in your garage? That’s what I have, effectively. I charge up at night and never
        need to go out of my way to find a gas station. That’s even more of an advantage when you consider all the weird
        stuff and odd people that always seem to find their way to the gas station at the same time as you. And
        especially for female riders, there’s one less chance for you to get accosted! (“Hey honey, what’s a little girl
        like you doing on such a big bike?”)
        But it’s not just charging that makes electric motorcycles more convenient. The maintenance savings alone are
        huge. In all of my riding electric motorcycles, I have changed exactly one part, a pulley bearing on a rear
        wheel. And I can’t even blame the electric motorcycle for that – all bearings have a lifespan, whether they are
        in a gas or electric motorcycle.
        Sure, you’ll have to deal with tire changes and brake pads eventually, but even brakes last much longer due to
        the regenerative braking of electric motorcycles.
    </p>
    <span11> Save money with an electric motorcycle</span11>
    <p class="text">
        This one might surprise you. Yes, electric motorcycles are still more expensive than gas motorcycles but
        Batteries simply aren’t coming down in price as quickly as other components.
        But after the initial purchase price, electric motorcycles will save you a ton of cash. Depending on your weekly
        commute, you could spend a few bucks in electricity instead of dozens in gas.
        Insurance is also another area where you can save significant cash. Electric motorcycles often get classified as
        smaller bikes, such as 250cc class, making them much cheaper to insure. This is likely because most insurers
        still don’t know how to deal with electric motorcycles, so it might not last forever. But in the meantime, it’s
        pretty funny that you can have a 100 hp electric motorcycle with a 0-60 mph time of under 3 seconds insured as a
        250cc bike.
