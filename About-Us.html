          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <h4>All the information about us</h4>
          <p>
            was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that
            people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric
            vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline
            cars. Today, show room builds not only all-electric vehicles but also
            infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products.
            show room believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels
            and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better. Launched in
            2008, the Roadster unveiled show room’s cutting-edge battery technology
            and electric powertrain. From there, show room designed the world’s
            first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S –
            which has become the best car in its class in every category.
            Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the
            world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the
            longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates
            that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration
            time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, show room
            expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and
            most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star
            safety ratings across every category from the National Highway
            Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret
            Master Plan,” in 2016, show room introduced Model 3, a low-priced,
            high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon
            after, show room unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever –
            show room Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over
            a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, show room unveiled
            Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and
            Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck
            and more performance than a sports car. show room vehicles are produced
            at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To
            achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, show room
            is taking a proactive approach to safety, requiring production
            employees to participate in a multi-day training program before ever
            setting foot on the factory floor. From there, show room continues to
            provide on-the-job training and track performance daily so that
            improvements can be made quickly. The result is that show room’s safety
            rate continues to improve while production ramps.
